Unsatisfied with the limitations of the interface and customization features, I dived into HTML, picking up CSS/PHP/MySQL over the years. Since then I've grown interested in how new web technologies are incorporated in some of the most visited websites. As the web has become increasingly fast paced with new frameworks and standards released every year, I have recognized the importance of humility and geniune interest in this field to succeed. I'm always learning!\\nI am currently an Interactive Arts (B.Sc) student at Simon Fraser University.",
